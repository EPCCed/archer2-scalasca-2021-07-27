Sample Score-P measurements

(bt-mz_C.8 run on a single node of Archer2 with 8 MPI processes each with 6 OpenMP threads)

scorep_bt-mz_C_8x6_sum.def/ 	       default (profile) measurement
scorep_bt-mz_C_8x6_sum.filt/	       filtered (profile) measurement
scorep_bt-mz_C_8x6_sum.hwc/	       filtered (profile) measurement with 2 hardware counters
scorep_bt-mz_C_8x6_trace/	       filtered trace measurement and automated analysis
scorep_bt-mz_sum/		       default (profile) measurement

(tea_leaf run on four nodes of JURECA@JSC with 8 MPI processes each with 12 OpenMP threads)

scorep_tea_leaf_baseline_8x12_sum/	default (profile) measurement (baseline version)
scorep_tea_leaf_baseline_8x12_trace/	trace measurement and automated analysis (baseline version)
scorep_tea_leaf_optimized_8x12_trace/	trace measurement and automated analysis (optimized version)
